# What is this?

A (hopefully) quick-loading, minimalistic weather forecast app built with React / NextJS to try out Zeit's "now" serverless platform (see: https://zeit.co/now)

# Demo of Current Master Branch

# TODO

1. Write some documentation!
2. Allow user to pick a different location.
3. Add user-selectable themes because styled-components makes it easy.
4. PWA-ify it!
